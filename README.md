## Go food Repository

Apart from being convenient and reliable, food delivery services are also a way for customers to gain access to limited offers and promotions. This works both ways: when the customer is saving up more on the delivery fees, theyâ€™ll more likely continue ordering from that app or platform. Likewise, the business owner is able to increase their revenue because more and more customers are ordering from them through the service.
